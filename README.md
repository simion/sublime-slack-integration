Sublime Text 3 slack.com integration plugin
=========================

A Sublime Text 3 plugin which integrates http://slack.com services.  
Currently the plugin is maintained but not developed, since I stopped using Sublime Text. if you want to contribute, I will analyze your pull request and make a release if everything is ok.

### Installation
Search for "Slack" package in Sublime Package Control

### Configuration
Open "Settings - User" from Preferences -> Package Settings -> Slack

    {
        "team_tokens": {
            "Team 1": "team-1-token-goes-here",
            "Team 2": "team-2-token-goes-here",
        },
        "username": "Sublime",
        "username_subtext": "via Sublime",
        "show_plaform_and_name": true,
        "repeat_file_ext": false,
        "avatar_url": "http://simionbaws.ro/icons/sublime-48.png"
    }

* ##### `"team_tokens"` (required)
    * A list of tokens you have, keyed by the team name that the token corresponds to.
    * You can get the token(s) from https://api.slack.com/web#auth (make sure you are authenticated on slack.com with your account)

* ##### `"username"` (required)
    * **defaults to "Sublime"**
    * The "sender" username that will be attributed to each message

* ##### `"username_subtext"`(optional)
    * The parenthetical subtext to show next to your username. Defaults to "via Sublime".
    * \*Note that if set, this setting will override the `"show_platform_and_name"` setting
    * \*Slack enforces that external plugins have parenthetical subtext next to the sender's username for each message.
  So if this option is omitted AND the `"show_platform_and_name"` setting is `false`, Slack adds the default subtext "bot", e.g., "myUser (bot)"

* ##### `"show_platform_and_name"` (optional)
    * **defaults to `true`**
    * if this is `true` and no setting is given for `username_subtext`, will use your name and your platform as the subtext to the username, e.g. "myUser (simion, linux)"

* ##### `"repeat_file_ext"` (optional)
    * **defaults to `false`**
    * If this is `true`, the name of the file being uploaded with have the extension repeated., e.g. `script.py` is uploaded as `script.py.py`.
    * \*This is meant to account for the fact that Slack, by default, chops off the file extension when displaying the filename. So uploading
  a file called `script.py` shows up in most places in Slack as just having the filename `script`.
With this option set to true, it would show up as `script.py` in Slack, at the expense of having the actual uploaded filename as `script.py.py`
    * \*See [Screenshots](#user-content-screenshots-file-uploads) below for examples

* ##### `"avatar_url"` (required)
    * url to the avatar image to use
    * **defaults to** [http://simionbaws.ro/icons/sublime-48.png](http://simionbaws.ro/icons/sublime-48.png)
    * ![alt text](http://simionbaws.ro/icons/sublime-48.png)
